Software Architecture for
Intelligent Email Processing and Response Automation System

I. Chosen Software Architecture Style
✅ Layered Architecture

I‑A. Justification: Why this system is Layered Architecture

Definition of Layered Architecture:

->Software is divided into distinct layers
->Each layer has a specific responsibility
->Layers interact only with adjacent layers

How our project fits this architecture:

->Components are clearly separated by functionality
->Each layer performs a well‑defined role
->Changes in one layer do not affect others

Granularity of components:

->Fine‑grained logical components
->Each layer contains related modules only
->High cohesion within layers, low coupling between layers
