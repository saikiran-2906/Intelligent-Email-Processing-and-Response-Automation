Justification of Architecture Style
(Layered Architecture)
✅ Definition of granularity:
->Granularity means how components are divided
->Each component handles one specific responsibility
->Components are logically separated, not mixed
->This improves clarity and modularity

✅ How our project shows layered granularity:
->Email processing is split into independent modules
->Each module performs a single function
->Modules communicate through clear interfaces
->No module directly controls another module’s internal logic

✅ Component separation in the system:
->UI handles only user interaction
->Classification module handles only email categorization
->Response module handles only auto‑reply generation
->Logger handles only data storage
->Admin module handles only system management
👉 Each component is small, focused, and replaceable.

✅ Independence of layers:
->Changing classification rules does not affect UI
->Changing UI does not affect logging
->Logging can be upgraded to a database without changing business logic
->Response templates can change without touching classifier
->This shows low coupling and high cohesion.

✅ Flow control is structured
